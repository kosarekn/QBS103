# Introduction to Machine Learning with R

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that seeks to develop alorithms based on input data to generate predictions or classifications on unseen data. Examples of machine learning applications are seen across a variety of fields from finance to healthcare. For example, a stockbroker may apply data scraped from X, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, or the news to her algorithm to capture social factors impacting trading and adequately predict trends in the stock market. Similarly, a clinical scientist may include histology staining and deleterious genetic markers to classify cancer subtypes. 

It's easy to get excited about implementing ML algorithms in your research given it's popularity, but it is important to take the time to understand the statistical framework behind your models. Today we will be exploring classical machine learning, which falls into two categories: supervised and unsupervised.

## Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning leverages labeled data to train algorithms to identify patterns and generate predictions on a similar data set. Supervised machine learning can be divided into classification and regression.
